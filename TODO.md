## Stuff to do
* Re-release all old versions under the new name
* Upload all available versions to Modrinth
* Update Github wiki with all the new information
* Datapack to change Archaeology loot tables
* Improve loot chests tables in general (Same datapack as the above one?)
* Cheaper rail recipes to encourage railway building early
* Do something with trial spawners, don't know yet, have to play with em first
* Split the code into versions for each Minecraft version, to allow multi-version development (1.20.X and 1.21.X for modded)
